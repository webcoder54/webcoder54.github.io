None of the things that "happened" are real except for the National Championship article and part of the Christmas and New Years.

THANK YOU Khan Academy for teaching me everything I know, and thank to Mrs. Mackin for starting Khan Acdemy and introducing it to me.

The Comment Function comes from A KHAN ACADEMY template and all credit for that goes to KHAN ACADEMY, but i did complete the Khan Acdemy challenge so I did the code and then copied it to do this

We had the whole family over and it was amazing I had so much fun playing with my cousins. I also had a gingerbread party and I made my gingerbread man loaded with candy, so he was fun to eat. I also went to my grandparents house and had a marshmellow fight, it was so cool and my team won. I also went on a Duck Boat tour and it was really fun. Here is a picture of a Christmas Tree.</p>

I bought a ton of "futuristic" things that now do not work, so the lesson is: If you go to Chicago do not buy the "futuristic" things. Though I do recommend going to Chicago because it was fun. If you do want to go to Chicago go to the help page in the help bar put in: I want to go to Chicago and then follow the directions.

        <h6 class = 'posted'>Posted on January 8, 2019  </h6>
        <p id = 'info-eight'>Last weekend(January 4 through January 5) I went on a Scholar's Bowl trip to Russellville. The trip was nine hours, but it was really fun. One the way up we went to McAlister's Deli and the waiter acted like I was 7, it was still fun though. When we got there we pulled into a Best Western and I shared a room with Bennet and Philip, and we may or may not have locked ourselves out. At 5:40 we went downstairs to the meeting room and played card games. We played to rounds of Uno and then one of the teachers who came with us joined. The game lasted for ever because someone get on swaping hands with whoever was winning. The guy who was swapping hands was about to win, but the teacher who came with us made an epic comeback. At night we watched some YouTube, played some Fortnite, and then got in bed. While in bed we talked for about 45 minutes, and there was a flickering lightbulb. We went to the competition and the 6th graders(my team) won two games, and the 7th and 8th graders won zero, and neither of us amde the playoff. On the way back I played Flats and then once my computer died just hung out on the bus. Anyway it was a very fun trip and I hope to do it again.  </p>
