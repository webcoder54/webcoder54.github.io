THANK YOU Khan Academy for teaching me everything I know, and thank to Mrs. Mackin for starting Khan Acdemy and introducing it to me.
The Comment Function comes from A KHAN ACADEMY template and all credit for that goes to KHAN ACADEMY, but i did complete the Khan Acdemy challenge so I did the code and then copied it to do this
This Contains HARRY POTTER SPOILERS
I also learned the Video function from Codecademy
I also learned the form function from Khan Acdemy, but did a challenge for the code.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

        <h6 class = 'posted'>Posted on January 8, 2019  </h6>
        <p id = 'info-eight'>Last weekend(January 4 through January 5) I went on a Scholar's Bowl trip to Russellville. The trip was nine hours, but it was really fun. One the way up we went to McAlister's Deli and the waiter acted like I was 7, it was still fun though. When we got there we pulled into a Best Western and I shared a room with Bennet and Philip, and we may or may not have locked ourselves out. At 5:40 we went downstairs to the meeting room and played card games. We played to rounds of Uno and then one of the teachers who came with us joined. The game lasted forever because someone get on swaping hands with whoever was winning. The guy who was swapping hands was about to win, but the teacher who came with us made an epic comeback. At night we watched some YouTube, played some Fortnite, and then got in bed. While in bed we talked for about 45 minutes, and there was a flickering lightbulb. We went to the competition and the 6th graders(my team) won two games, and the 7th and 8th graders won zero, and neither of us made the playoff. On the way back I played Flats and then once my computer died just hung out on the bus. Anyway it was a very fun trip and I hope to do it again.  </p>

<p id = 'info-ten'> Today I <strong>tried</strong> to make a website on WordPress and Wix. Keyword there is tried. I do not know how to do all of that fancy stuff, because I am used to coding with simple p tags and h1 tags. To me just coding a website is <strong>MUCH</strong> easier! I kept on trying and trying and trying to be succesful at regular website apps, but I cannot get I am am just used to using simple code to make websites. I hope that somebody will teach me how to do wordPress or Wix, because right now I can do nothing on it. Sorry I went on for so long about that it is just that I am mad. </p>

<p id = 'info-eleven'> Do you know what Tannerite is? Probably not unless if you have a hunting camp. Tannerite is like a legal explosive that only explodes on high impact like being shot by a 2 70 gun. So christmas of 2017 I got tannerite from my uncle, so we went to our hunting camp to shoot it. When we got to our hunting camp we went to the rifle range and got everything set up. When we got there we also figured out that our uncle had brought soda. We taped the tannerite to a tree and blew up a tree about two times. Then we taped the soda to a tree(after having a sip) and blow up a tree with soda on it about two times. Anyway it was fun, and if you want a good video just search up tannerite videos on youtube. Though I have a video below. </p>

        <h2 id = 'fourt-post' class = 'post'> Ski Trip in Gatlinburg </h2>
        <h6 class = 'posted'> Posted on January 22, 2019 </h6>
        <p id = 'info-fourt'> (CLICK THE PARAGRAPH!) It was amazing! On the bus I sat Parker, Dylan, and Elliott. We had a lot of fun playing games until it happened. We pulled into a gas station, stopped, and noticed that the High School boy's bus was smoking. Five minutes later, we pulled into the exact same gas station. We stayed there for about one hour and thirty minutes while the adults TRIED to fix the bus. Finally the adults decided to move the high schoolers to the boys and girls bus. It was CROWDED. The rest of the ride was just me and Thomas Allen, from Scholar's Bowl, talking about anime. Then Dylan fell on us three times, so me and TA took the two seats, Dylan went to the floor, and Parker went to the floor. This whole time Elliott was sleeping. We finally get to Camp Wesley Woods, go to our bunkrooms, and go to sleep, without a pillow. The next morning I wake up, talk to Elliott and Dylan, bundle up, and go to the place where we eat breakfast. We play some good Uno, until we have to get our pillows and then we just stop. We sit down, all of us, sing praise, and then listen to a long, but good, sermon by Macon. Then we finally get dressed to ski, and before we leave I lose my tooth. I sit with Silas on the way to Gatlinburg, an hour trip, and he does magic tricks. We get there, do paperwork, get in line for the Tram, get our boots, get our skis, get our helmets, and then finally head out to ski. I was REJECTED to ski schools because I didn't have my papers, but I got Mr. Davidson to teach me. I learned on the bunny slope and then finally got on the green turny slope, and fell a lot. We went back to the cabins, put our clothes out to dry, and then went to bed. We woke up had a devotional, ate breakfast, had another long sermon and sang songs, and set out yet again to ski. I skied with a lot of people, but ate lunch with Emma and GinnyLou. Whan we had to return our stuff I sat in a long line when I could have just put my boots on the desk. This caused me to have to go home with the girls with TA. We got back had showers, had lows, highs, and a devotional, and then went to bed. On the way back I was in Elliott's car with his parents, himself, Dylan, and Parker. We played My Cow, learned about the Merrick family, watched Transformers, went to Chick-fil-a, and had singing competitions. The trip was really fun!    </p>

I have about 32 wins and like 500+ kills. I know that you don't care about this, I am mostly just doing this for a video opportunity, and a form oppertunity. Please watch the video, and take the form. You can also leave in the comments if you like it. You can also tell me how many wins you have (if you play). </p>

        <h6 class = 'posted'> Posted on Febuary 3, 2019 </h6>
        <p id = 'info-sixt'> It is the day of the Super Bowl! In the morning I played Fortnite, went to Church, watched my brothers play Fortnite and Terraria, played Soccer, practiced Typing Pal, and read. Then we started the game and all I did was read most of the time, and watched commercials. Then I finished my book, we had dinner, ribs, beans, and broccoli, and we resumed watching the show. Then I did some SQL and Ruby, made some edits to the blog, and searched up how to make it better. Oh wait, I just realized that this is supposed to be about the Super Bowl, anyway the score now is 10-3 Patriots with 2:25 left in the game. I will give the final score later:<span id = 'sb-report'> 13-3 Patriots won. </span> </p>
