THANK YOU Khan Academy for teaching me everything I know, and thank to Mrs. Mackin for starting Khan Acdemy and introducing it to me.
The Comment Function comes from A KHAN ACADEMY template and all credit for that goes to KHAN ACADEMY, but i did complete the Khan Acdemy challenge so I did the code and then copied it to do this

I bought a ton of "futuristic" things that now do not work, so the lesson is: If you go to Chicago do not buy the "futuristic" things. Though I do recommend going to Chicago because it was fun. If you do want to go to Chicago go to the help page in the help bar put in: I want to go to Chicago and then follow the directions.

        <h6 class = 'posted'>Posted on January 8, 2019  </h6>
        <p id = 'info-eight'>Last weekend(January 4 through January 5) I went on a Scholar's Bowl trip to Russellville. The trip was nine hours, but it was really fun. One the way up we went to McAlister's Deli and the waiter acted like I was 7, it was still fun though. When we got there we pulled into a Best Western and I shared a room with Bennet and Philip, and we may or may not have locked ourselves out. At 5:40 we went downstairs to the meeting room and played card games. We played to rounds of Uno and then one of the teachers who came with us joined. The game lasted forever because someone get on swaping hands with whoever was winning. The guy who was swapping hands was about to win, but the teacher who came with us made an epic comeback. At night we watched some YouTube, played some Fortnite, and then got in bed. While in bed we talked for about 45 minutes, and there was a flickering lightbulb. We went to the competition and the 6th graders(my team) won two games, and the 7th and 8th graders won zero, and neither of us made the playoff. On the way back I played Flats and then once my computer died just hung out on the bus. Anyway it was a very fun trip and I hope to do it again.  </p>

I kept on trying and trying and trying to be succesful at regular website apps, but I cannot get I am am just used to using simple code to make websites.

<p id = 'info-eleven'> Do you know what Tannerite is? Probably not unless if you have a hunting camp. Tannerite is like a legal explosive that only explodes on high impact like being shot by a 2 70 gun. So christmas of 2017 I got tannerite from my uncle, so we went to our hunting camp to shoot it. When we got to our hunting camp we went to the rifle range and got everything set up. When we got there we also figured out that our uncle had brought soda. We taped the tannerite to a tree and blew up a tree about two times. Then we taped the soda to a tree(after having a sip) and blow up a tree with soda on it about two times. Anyway it was fun, and if you want a good video just search up tannerite videos on youtube. Though I have a video below. </p>
