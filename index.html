        <p id = 'info-four'>I went to Chicago and it was amazing. I saw a ton of cool stuff like giant buildings. I also met up with my friend, William! In Chicago I had so much fun with William! I bought a ton of "futuristic" things that now do not work, so the lesson is: If you go to Chicago do not buy the "futuristic" things. Though I do recommend going to Chicago because it was fun.
